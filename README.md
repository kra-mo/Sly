# About the Project

Sly is a friendly image editor that requires no internet connection or preexisting expertise. Just open some photos and have at it.

The app allows you to adjust attributes like brightness or contrast as well as add effects like a vignette or a border. It also allows you to flip, rotate and crop the image to your heart's desire. If you're a pro, you can even preview your edits on a histogram.

When you're done, just save the photo with the quality settings of your choosing. You also get a choice in whether or not to keep metadata such as location information.

## Other Platforms

I'm planning to make the app available for all other major platforms (iOS, macOS, Windows) in the near future.

For now, if you want to try out the app, you can do so at [sly.kramo.page](https://sly.kramo.page). Be aware that this version is unstable and the performance will probably be significantly worse than that of the native app.

**Issues for each platform can be found here:**

- iOS - https://github.com/kra-mo/sly/issues/11
- macOS - https://github.com/kra-mo/sly/issues/9
- Windows - https://github.com/kra-mo/sly/issues/10

## Localization

For now, localization of the app is not possible, but I plan to set up translations in the near future.
